🌊 FlashFlood AI
Real-Time Flash Flood Prediction, Risk Corridors & Recovery Zones

By VisionZero AI — Civic Innovation in Disaster Response

📘 Overview

FlashFlood AI is a public demonstration of the high-level flash-flood intelligence developed by Anuar Aubakirov for:

Guadalupe River Flash Flood — Texas (July 2025)

Coyote Creek / Arroyo Coyote — San José, CA

Rapid multi-mile surge prediction

Debris-catchment & recovery zone forecasting

This repository contains safe, non-sensitive materials for civic partners, innovation hubs, and emergency planners.
All core algorithms, ML models, and real geospatial engines remain private for IP protection.

⭐ Key Features (Public Version)
🔹 Flood Corridor Visual Maps

Simplified illustrations of how flash-flood surges propagate through constricted river channels.

🔹 Guadalupe River (2025)

Visuals from Texas’ deadly flash flood event; includes mapping logic referenced by SAR community observers.

🔹 Coyote Creek (San José)

Early flood-path sketches and logic for the upcoming VisionZero AI “Coyote Creek Flash Flood Map.”

🔹 Terrain & Gradient Influence

Non-sensitive descriptions showing how elevation and slope impact flood velocity.

🔹 Example Data

GeoJSON / DEM examples demonstrating structural formats without revealing sensitive data.

🔹 Documentation for Cities

Readable, high-level explanations suitable for emergency agencies, planners, and innovation hubs.

🔐 Protected / Proprietary Components (NOT included)

These remain inside the private VisionZero AI & Praedicta AI repositories:

High-resolution DEM datasets

Flood-velocity acceleration formulas

Channel narrowing models

SAR debris-catchment probability logic

Real-time SQL/PostGIS flood propagation engine

Machine learning model weights & scripts

Predictive hazard routing engine

Sensitive datasets or city-owned inputs

This protects both IP and operational security.
